# core.logic exercises

This repo contains exercises originally assembled by Gary Fredericks
for a Chicago Clojure workshop. They were hosted on a port of the
4clojure.com Website for awhile.

## Usage?

The workflow is "koan-style:" edit `src/clojic/solutions.clj` and either run

    clojure -Arunprobs

or uncomment and evaluate the form at the bottom of `solutions.clj`.
A hint will appear for every problem and execution will stop at the
next problem that needs solving.

## Contributions?

I'd be happy to take pull requests to improve the workflow, or to
add/improve problems.
