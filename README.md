# 4clojure core.logic problems

This repo is where I'm publicly dumping the core.logic problems that
I assembled for a Chicago Clojure workshop and had deployed at
4clojure.gfredericks.com for a while.

## Usage?

I don't think the problems are in the exact data format that 4clojure
expects; I think I had a real basic script that did that (to keep the
repetition low). So if you want to setup your own 4clojure with these
problems it will not be trivial, but hopefully not hard.

## Contributions?

I'd be happy to take pull requests to either make the issues in the
above section easier, or to add/improve problems.
